# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  missing error handling for invalid input.  Specifically, the route `/users/:id` attempts to parse the `id` parameter as an integer without any validation or error handling. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the `id` parameter is not a valid integer.

## Bug Description
The provided code attempts to fetch a user from an array based on their ID. However, it doesn't handle cases where the `id` parameter is not a valid integer or if a user with the provided ID does not exist. This can lead to runtime errors (like `NaN` comparisons) or sending incorrect responses.

## Bug Solution
The solution demonstrates how to robustly handle potential errors by:

1. **Validating the ID:** Checking if `req.params.id` is a valid integer using `isNaN()` before using `parseInt()`.
2. **Handling non-existent users:** Explicitly checking if the user exists in the `users` array before sending a response. This avoids potential errors and sends a clear 404 response when a user is not found.
3. **Handling other errors:** Implementing a general error handler using `app.use()` to capture any unhandled errors and send appropriate responses. 

This example shows how to write more secure and reliable Express.js applications by anticipating potential errors and implementing proper error handling mechanisms.
